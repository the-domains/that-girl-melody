# I salute you Cheesy Weezies, but this is goodbye.

For the unacquainted, Cheesy Weezies are a Bay of Plenty delicacy from the 90's. Think: hot chips doused in mayo' and topped with melted cheese. Arguably they _are_ a fat laden stack of carbohydrates, wrapped in newspaper and disguised as a delicious accompaniment to your battered fish. In short, they do not receive the heart foundation tick of approval.

What they do receive though, is the undivided attention of my taste buds. And today, I said screw it, after 3+ months of eating carefully, painfully so, I stuffed my face with these delightful heart stopping, potato soldiers and loved every mother chucking minute of it. Throw in a couple of pieces of white bread, a sausage and my gastronomical sinning was complete. 

Can I get an, amen?

What I hadn't prepared myself for was the aftermath. Having been dairy  free for, I don't know how long and very rarely eating deep fried food, this dynamic duo did not agree with my body. Cue, a mid day sleep, sludge stomach and guilt, a whole lot of guilt.

I'm sorry body. It was a moment of weakness and I shalt not sin again, at least not with Cheesy Weezies. 

The horrible feelings post-weezie, pig out prompted a visit to the gym in an attempt to make myself feel better. Nuh uh, didn't work. There was no consolation thrashing it out on the bike nor sweating it out in the sauna. In fact I still feel bleurgh and it's been 8 hours since I ate the tasty little bastards.

What is the lesson here, boys and girls?

Sometimes shit happens, you have days when you want to devour an entire bucket of KFC, your mind tricks you into eating foods you know will have dire consequences but you do it anyway. Embrace these times, experience them, get it out of your system and keep on keeping on.

Remember though, how that food made you feel. Do you want to feel that way again? I doubt it. I enjoyed the Cheesy Weezies for their tastiness in the moment, but that's it for me. The consequences just aren't worth it and I am putting my body first. After all it has had to put up with my obsessive training, change in nutrition and countless years of being pretty unkind. 

My body deserves to be number \#1 and I will honour that. No promises on future food indiscretions, but I can promise less self chastising and a conscious effort to keep myself in check.

I salute you and thank you for the lessons, Cheesy Weezies, and this is goodbye.
