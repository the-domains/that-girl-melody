# Princess, Slay the Junk in that Trunk: No Magic Required

I'm sorry to break it to you Cinderella, but the reality is, those late nights spent feverishly shopping online for magical fat burning elixirs, the kind you drop a weeks wages on, are more likely to turn you into a pumpkin as opposed to a Victoria's Secret Angel. Legitimate, quick fixes to losing weight are nothing more than a fairy tale.

The eternal quest for _the_ weight loss holy grail, the one potion to rule them all, is an age old story full of woe, disappointment and clever marketing campaigns. If you want to drop weight, no amount of 'miracle' body wraps, fat burning tea or 7 day lemon/cardiac/god-knows-what-else diets are going to give you the long term results you want. Trust me, as the ultimate weight loss industry consumer, I've tried almost every gimmick out there and to no avail.

Don't get me wrong, people _do_ get short term results, but from my observations and first hand experience, the triumphs are closely followed by a diet reversal straight back to old eating habits. The kilos shed sneak back to your hips, enlarge the junk in that trunk and join forces with your stomach to create the muffin top you worked, admittedly very little, to be rid of.

If you are anything like the old me, these defeats induced a hangry\*, food fuelled rage and binge, resulting in unhappiness, a firm resolve to 'stick to it....next time' and then the cycle starts all over again -- with a shiny, new fad product.

Please, raise your hand if this sounds like you?

Many of us who crave a smaller dress size also yearn for lightning fast results with the least amount of effort and no change in lifestyle. Sad but true.

It's how we roll as a society nowadays, in this digital age that demands instant gratification, a throwaway culture of self entitled, privileged human beings who truly believe they deserve everything, yesterday. This attitude unfortunately permeates not only the health and beauty industry, but is prevalent everywhere.

I believe that this is a really shit attitude to adopt. You have to expend some energy, get off your arse and be prepared to put in some work to achieve what you want. Life isn't all sunshine and lollipops served up on a silver platter, you possess the power to create that happy ending you've always wanted, to claim back the body of your youth and wardrobe of your dreams.

You **_can _**do it.

Yes-you-can.**I believe in you**.

And you don't need the whizz bang, fat zapping, bank account leeching concoctions to do it.

It's simple. Take 1 part you, a little discipline, a dash of focus and the want to change. Be prepared to sometimes fail, but in the immortal lyrics of the late Aaliyah, to [dust yourself off and try again.][0]

Don't convince yourself that you have to go all out either. A fancy new active wear wardrobe, gym membership, personal trainer, nutritionist, and food overhaul are not required immediately, or at all.

At the core, it's about changing your outlook, considering what you put in your mouth, the extra curricular activities you partake in and taking it one day at a time. Making incremental changes in your everyday life until it ain't a thing.

Don't over think it. Just start, like, right now. Don't have two helpings of ice cream, just have one. Park a little further away from the entrance at the supermarket so you walk a few more steps. Drink more water and reduce the fizzy. Be aware of what you are doing and make conscious decisions, life tweaks if you will, on the little things and work your way up.

And you know what? miraculous changes start to take place. Your body will rejoice in the love and attention you're showering upon it and responds with endorphins of happiness. You start to feel great, you have more energy, psychologically you make better informed choices about nutrition, all of a sudden you _want_ to take that walk/do a dance class/wash the car or mow the lawns. You breathe easier, sleep better and smile more.

Who _doesn't _want to feel like this?

Great health, a fit body and happier you aren't elusive, unobtainable goals. There is no fairy weight-loss godmother required, it's all up to you. You just have to be prepared to change things up and have a little patience.

Jump aboard the golden carriage of a healthier you, Cinderella. Ride past midnight and watch yourself transform into a healthier version of yourself. No pumpkins here, unless it's at the dinner table.

You _can_live happily ever after.

It's time to create your own magic,**today.**

**\* Hangry**-- Angry hunger.
